This video presentation examines key challenges facing modern society, with particular focus on digital addiction, misinformation, youth unemployment, data privacy concerns, and unequal access to technological resources. As societies become increasingly dependent on digital platforms, new social, economic, and ethical complexities continue to emerge.

One major challenge is the excessive consumption of digital content, particularly among young people, which affects productivity, mental health, and social interaction. Additionally, the rapid spread of misinformation through social media platforms undermines public trust, civic engagement, and informed decision-making. Youth unemployment also remains a pressing issue, particularly in developing economies, where limited access to technological skills widens socio-economic inequality.

The presentation proposes technology-driven and policy-supported solutions. These include promoting digital literacy education, encouraging responsible computing practices, strengthening data protection frameworks, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship, and developing inclusive digital platforms that empower youth economically.

By integrating responsible technological development with social awareness and ethical leadership, Information Technology can serve not only as a tool for economic advancement but also as an instrument for sustainable social transformation in modern society.
